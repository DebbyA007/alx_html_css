# ALX HTML CSS Advanced Project

## Description

This project is part of the ALX Frontend curriculum, focusing on advanced HTML and CSS implementation. The goal is to create a pixel-perfect website based on a Figma design, demonstrating proficiency in modern web development techniques without the use of external libraries or frameworks.
